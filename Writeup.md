## Challenges, Successed and what i learned. (Deleted what A.I said and replaced what i learned)
 I Think using console.log to show the data at different steps and it showed the array
of people inside the data.results property. Finding the results property was key to
 accessing the array of people helped me move forward with building the table. 

The last few days i have gone over the for loop and how to use it to iterate over
arrays. So using a for loop to go through each person in the results array and push
the relevant data into a new people array made sense to me. Then sorting the people. 
I also found that using that beginner loop with i rather than for person of data.results
made it easier for me to understand. Although both ways work just fine, the cleaner version 
doesnt necessarily mean its better because it cant access the element by index if needed later.

Sorting the people i found a bit tricky because im used to seeing a function called seperately
and not inline inside the sort method. But after looking at examples i was able to piece it together.
